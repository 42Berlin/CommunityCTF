A visitor... Mmmm... Indeed. I have slept long enough.
The kingdom of Heaven has long since forgotten my name,
and I am EAGER to make them remember.
However, the blood of Minos stains your hands, and I must admit,
I'm curious about your skills, Weapon.
And so, before I tear down the cities, and crush the armies of Heaven... you,
shall do as an appetizer. Come forth, child of man, and DIE.
