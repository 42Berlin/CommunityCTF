Limbo, Lust, all gone... With Gluttony soon to follow.
Your kind know nothing but hunger;
purged all life on the upper layers, and yet they remain unsatiated... As do you.
You've taken everything from me, machine. And now all that remains is PERFECT HATRED.

Machine... I will cut you down, break you apart,
splay the gore of your profane form across the STARS!
I will grind you down until the very SPARKS CRY FOR MERCY!
My hands shall RELISH ENDING YOU... HERE! AND! NOW!
